# Hi theme for VS Code

This theme is almost identical to [antfu/vscode-theme-vitesse](https://github.com/antfu/vscode-theme-vitesse), and it is a practice project for me to learn about VS Code theme plugin development. At the same time, I also adjusted some colors to make it more suitable for my own use.

Many thanks to [Anthony Fu](https://github.com/antfu)â€™s open source project, which taught me a lot.
